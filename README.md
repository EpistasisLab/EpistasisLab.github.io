This is the documentation page for the [Epistasis Lab](http://epistasis.org), a research group in the [Institute for Biomedical Informatics](http://upibi.org/) at UPenn.

In a nutshell, our lab develops computational methods to identify the complex genetic architectures that lead to human disease. Our methods address [challenges](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v11/n6/full/nrg2809.html) such as epistasis, heterogeneity, and scalability.  

You can browse our projects below for more information.
